# Livestock Report of Bihar (2019) Dashboard  

## Overview  
I developed this Power BI report to analyze the livestock distribution across districts of Bihar for 2019. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand trends, identify key metrics, and make data-driven decisions.  

## Steps to Create and Publish the Report  

### Data Loading and Preparation  
1. I sourced the data from the Bihar Livestock Census 2019 dataset available on Kaggle.  
2. Using Power BI's "Get Data" feature, I imported the datasets into the Power BI environment.  
3. I carefully inspected the structure of each dataset to ensure consistency in column names and formats.  

### Data Transformation  
4. I cleaned the data by removing irrelevant columns and rows that were not required for analysis.  
5. I added calculated columns and measures to include key metrics like total livestock populations and relevant dates.  
6. To ensure accuracy, I cross-verified the transformed data with the original source to align it with the analysis objectives.  

### Report Design and Features  
7. I created an interactive slicer panel (accessible via a filter icon on the right) to enable district-level filtering.  
8. For visualization, I designed bar charts, line graphs, and summary cards to represent data for each livestock type.  
9. I highlighted the top 5 districts for each livestock category in a dedicated section to make key insights easily accessible.  
10. I organized the report into three pages:  
    - **Page 1:** Overview showing total livestock populations across all categories.  
    - **Page 2:** Detailed analysis of specific livestock categories like cattle, goats, and buffaloes.  
    - **Page 3:** Highlights of top-performing districts for each livestock type.  
11. I applied a consistent theme with carefully chosen colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure the report is visually appealing and easy to read.  

### Publishing and Sharing  
12. After completing the design, I published the report to the Power BI Service to make it accessible to stakeholders.  
13. I shared the report with relevant stakeholders via a direct Power BI link for easy access and collaboration.
